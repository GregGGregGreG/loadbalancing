Load Balancing with Weighted Round Robin (WRR) and Least Connection First 


Current Status
==============

The status quo of our implementation fulfills virtually every requirement that had been assigned to us before Mr. Borko added new tasks. Mr. Micheler sent Mr. Scholz a mail saying that there is going to be a review on the January 9th 2014, hence our documentation does not comply with the so called "Metaregeln", thus missing .jar, Javadoc, and protocol.
